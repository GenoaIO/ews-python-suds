Exchange Web Services fork of Python Suds and EWS Wrapper

This project is the merger of two projects, assembled to provide a single package for integration to Microsoft Exchange. It was been developed and tested against Exchange 2007 SP_1.

The two projects are:
    Python-Suds (0.4) licensed under LGPL [https://github.com/fabrique/python-suds]
    EWSWrapper  (0.2) licensed under New BSD License [http://ewswrapper.lafiel.net/]

We have applied the EWSWapper patch to python-suds and extended EWSwrapper with configuration options adding a tornado package dependency.

python-ntlm package is also required a requirement.
